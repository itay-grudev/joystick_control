# FAQ

## WTF is this `joystick_control` Itay?

Well I recently got a Logitech G X56 HOTAS controller and because it's always on
my desk I decided to give it functions not only when I'm playing a game, like:
* Volume control
* Switching between headphones and speakers and moving existing audio outputs to the corresponding sink
* Individual control of the volume of speakers and headphones (sometimes I'm listening to music while on a call).

## What else can it do?

For now - just that. I add stuff as I need them.

## Why share something this silly then?

You may be able to adapt it for something else. It's kind of universal.

## Why Python?

Why not... It's pretty easy to prototype something like this, and every major Linux distro comes with Python installed.

## Can it do `X`?

Most likely.

## Can I use it for my stuff?

Yes you can, although I choose to distribute it under GPL so you have to make any changes you make open source. I would like to improve the project over time, so feel free to send me MRs.
